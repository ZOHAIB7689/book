## Overview

This textbook teaches students how to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots by integrating AI systems with physical bodies. The content is organized to guide readers from basic concepts to complex implementation, bridging the gap between digital AI systems and physical robotic embodiment.

## Technologies

- ROS 2 (Humble / Iron)
- Gazebo
- Unity (visualization & interaction)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
- LLM-driven planning for robotics

## Getting Started
