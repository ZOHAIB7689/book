# Exercises: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Exercise 1.1: Embodiment Analysis

### Objective
Analyze how physical properties influence cognitive processes in biological and artificial systems.

### Instructions
1. Choose an everyday object (e.g., hammer, chair, cup).
2. Identify the affordances the object offers (what actions it enables).
3. Consider how the object's physical properties (size, weight, shape, material) influence its use.
4. Imagine how the object would need to change to afford different actions.
5. Reflect on how these physical constraints might influence decision-making when using the object.

### Deliverable
Write a one-page analysis of your chosen object, describing its affordances, how physical properties influence its use, and how these constraints might affect cognitive processing.

## Exercise 1.2: Sensorimotor Mapping

### Objective
Explore the relationship between actions and sensory feedback.

### Instructions
1. Close your eyes and manipulate a familiar object (e.g., pen, key) with one hand.
2. Pay attention to the proprioceptive and tactile feedback you receive.
3. Try to identify the object without visual input based only on this feedback.
4. Map the relationship between specific movements and sensory changes.
5. Consider how this sensorimotor mapping contributes to object recognition.

### Deliverable
Create a diagram showing the sensorimotor mapping you discovered, with specific movements on one side and resulting sensory changes on the other.

## Exercise 1.3: Morphological Computation in Nature

### Objective
Identify examples of morphological computation in biological systems.

### Instructions
1. Research a biological system that demonstrates morphological computation (e.g., fish fins, bird wings, human hand).
2. Describe how the physical structure simplifies control or enhances functionality.
3. Identify how the system adapts to environmental changes through physical properties rather than active control.
4. Consider how this mechanism could be applied to humanoid robotics.

### Deliverable
Prepare a 5-minute presentation describing your chosen biological system, highlighting the physical properties that contribute to its function, and proposing a robotic application.

## Exercise 1.4: Simple Robot Simulation

### Objective
Experience the difference between symbolic and embodied approaches to robotics.

### Instructions
1. Use a simple robot simulator (like the one provided with this textbook) or a physical robot platform.
2. Program the robot to navigate to a target using a purely symbolic approach (predefined path).
3. Next, implement a simple embodied approach (e.g., light following, obstacle avoidance).
4. Compare the robustness and adaptability of each approach when environmental conditions change.
5. Document the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

### Deliverable
A report comparing your symbolic and embodied approaches, including code, simulation results, and analysis of when each approach is most appropriate.

## Exercise 1.5: Robot Embodiment Analysis

### Objective
Analyze how the physical form of a robot affects its interaction with the environment.

### Instructions
1. Select two robots with different physical forms (e.g., wheeled vs. legged, different arm configurations).
2. Identify tasks that each robot would perform well and tasks where it would struggle.
3. Consider how the robot's embodiment influences the types of problems it can solve efficiently.
4. Reflect on how human-like embodiment in humanoid robots affects their utility in human environments.

### Deliverable
A comparative analysis of the two robots, including sketches of their forms, lists of appropriate tasks, and discussion of how physical form influences capability.
