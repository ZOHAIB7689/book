# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Embodied Intelligence to Autonomous Humanoids

This textbook teaches students how to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots by integrating AI systems with physical bodies. The content is organized to guide readers from basic concepts to complex implementation, bridging the gap between digital AI systems and physical robotic embodiment.

## About This Book

This comprehensive guide covers the fundamental concepts and practical implementation of humanoid robotics using modern technologies:

- **ROS 2** (Humble / Iron) for robot middleware and communication
- **Gazebo** for physics simulation and testing
- **Unity** for visualization and interaction
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS** for advanced simulation
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems** for perception and interaction
- **LLM-driven planning** for intelligent robot behavior
