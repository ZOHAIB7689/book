# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook! This comprehensive resource is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation in the rapidly evolving field of embodied intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical embodiment—creating systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital domains, Physical AI systems must navigate the complexities of the physical world, dealing with uncertainty, real-time constraints, and continuous sensorimotor interactions.

## Why This Textbook?

The field of humanoid robotics is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by advances in:

- **Deep Learning & Computer Vision** - Enabling robots to perceive and understand their environment
- **Reinforcement Learning** - Allowing robots to learn complex behaviors through trial and error
- **Sensor Technology** - Providing rich multimodal data for decision-making
- **Actuator Systems** - Delivering more precise and human-like motion
- **Computational Power** - Processing complex algorithms in real-time

However, there's a significant gap between academic research and practical implementation. This textbook aims to fill that gap by providing:

- **Theoretical Foundations** - Core concepts in robotics, AI, and control theory
- **Practical Implementation** - Hands-on tutorials with ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- **Real-World Examples** - Case studies from leading humanoid robotics projects
- **Progressive Learning** - From basics to advanced topics in a structured manner
