# Physical AI Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Academic Rigor
All content must be academically rigorous, building from first principles with mathematical precision. Each concept must be explained with theoretical foundations before practical application. Diagrams and examples must be accompanied by textual descriptions to ensure accessibility.

### Pedagogical Progression
Content must follow a logical pedagogical progression where each chapter builds upon previous concepts. Prerequisites are explicitly stated before new concepts are introduced. Students must be able to follow the material sequentially without gaps in understanding.

### Technical Precision (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Technical terminology must be precise and consistently applied throughout the textbook. Definitions precede usage, and any ambiguity in technical terms must be resolved before publication. Mathematical notation follows standard conventions in robotics and AI literature.

### Practical Relevance
Every theoretical concept must connect to real-world applications in physical AI systems like robots, autonomous vehicles, and interactive systems. Hardware constraints, computational limitations, and safety considerations must be discussed alongside theoretical frameworks.

### Accessibility and Clarity
Content must be accessible to university students with technical literacy but no prior knowledge of physical AI. Complex derivations are broken into comprehensible steps. Code examples (where applicable) must be well-commented and educational in purpose.

### Systematic Documentation
Each chapter follows a standardized structure: introduction, theory, systems (architecture/components), implementation, labs (exercises), and summary. This ensures consistent learning experience across all topics.

## University-Level Textbook Requirements

This is a TEXTBOOK, not a blog, tutorial series, or marketing site. Writing style must be academic, instructional, and precise. No emojis, no hype language, no storytelling fluff. Every concept must be explained from first principles. Diagrams must be described textually. Real-world constraints must be discussed (latency, hardware limits, safety). Each chapter must build on previous chapters. No skipped reasoning steps.

## Docusaurus Structure Compliance

All content must strictly follow Docusaurus classic documentation structure. One chapter = one folder. Each chapter folder must contain: introduction.md, theory.md, systems.md (architecture, components, pipelines), implementation.md (code-level or config-level explanation), labs.md (hands-on exercises), summary.md. Markdown only (.md). Sidebar-driven navigation. File and folder names must be lowercase and kebab-case. Content must be suitable for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Academic Standards

Content must be suitable for university-level instruction. Concepts are explained from foundational principles without assuming prior specialized knowledge. Exercises and labs provide hands-on experience reinforcing theoretical concepts. Mathematical proofs and derivations are included where pedagogically valuable.

## Governance

This constitution establishes the fundamental requirements for all contributions to the Physical AI textbook project. All content, structure, and development must comply with these principles. Deviations require explicit constitutional amendments following the formal amendment process. All pull requests must be reviewed for compliance with these standards.
