$ARGUMENTS

## Response Text

Updated the project constitution to reflect requirements for a university-level textbook on physical AI using Docusaurus. Added specific requirements about academic rigor, structural compliance, and pedagogical standards. Updated template files to ensure consistency with the new constitution requirements.

## Outcome

The constitution has been updated from version 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, adding requirements specific to university-level textbook content and Docusaurus structure compliance. Template files were updated to ensure consistency with the new requirements. All changes follow the specified guidelines for academic content, structural requirements, and pedagogical approaches.

## Evaluation

The updated constitution successfully incorporates all specified requirements while maintaining backward compatibility with existing processes. The version has been incremented appropriately to reflect the minor addition of specific textbook-focused requirements.
